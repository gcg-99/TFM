# Analysis of the transcriptional network regulated by the TCP transcription factor BRANCHED1

This Master's thesis is part of the project **'CENTRAL INTEGRATORS OF STIMULI CONTROLLING BRANCHING: BRC1-SMXL INTERACTIONS'**.

Here we combine existing and new transcriptomic and protein-DNA binding data to elucidate the gene regulatory networks controlled directly and indirectly by *BRC1*.
